            <h3>Indigenous Services Canada Website Redesign</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">The ISC site was in dire need for a revamp as it was confusing to navigate and understand content,and the side was not welcoming or attractive. We propose a new pirmary Nav to help reorganize the content in a more user friendly way. We also suggest adding more color and making the site more inviting. The proposed ideas will transform the user experience and allow them to find what they are looking for faster and spend less time on the site lost.</p>

            <h3>Phase 1 - User Research</h3>
        </header>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">The user research portion began with a research plan and 5 one on one usibility tests. Huristic evaluation and color audit were also performed to get a scope of the current site</p>

            <img class="inline-block" src="images/colorAnalysis2.png">

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">As a government website it was expected to pass the color audit. The Heuristic evaluation revealed the site was confusing from the content to the navigation</p>

            <h3>Phase 2 - Definition & Synthesis</h3>
        </header>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Next came the Affinity diagram, Protopersona, and user flow. This stage allowed us to take the feedback from the tests and identify the user pain points.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">User testings were performed 1 on 1 with 5 users of varying technological abilities and age. The Affinity Diagram gave us these 5 pain points/positive points from the current site:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="inline-block center">
            <li>Navigation is confusing</li>
            <li>Too much information (it is hard to find what you are looking for)</li>
            <li>Font size is good, very accessible</li>
            <li>Aesthetically boring</li>
            <li>Information is difficult to understand and hard to digest</li>
        </ol>

        <header>
            <h3>Phase 3 - Ideation</h3>
        </header>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Ideation came with many moodboards, card sorting, and site maps. Now knowing the user painpoints, we can plan the changes to better the user experience and add stylstic enhancements.</p>

            <h3>Phase 4 - Prototyping </h3>
        </header>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Prototyping stage came with lots of back and forth with testing and prototyping. I also find more of a style path for the new site as I create the prototype</p>

        <div class="flex space-evently">
            <b>Low-Fi</b>
            <b>High-Fi</b>
            </div>

            <img class="Largerimages" src="images/IteratedV3.png">
        </div>

        <div class="flex space-evently">
            <b>Low-Fi</b>
            <b>High-Fi</b>
        </div>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">After some A/B testing, we changed our colors for the Hi-Fi final product</p>
    
        <header>
            <h3>Phase 5: User Testing + Outcomes </h3>
        </header>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Usubility testing consisted of 8 users either doing A/B testing or general usubility testing. My findings helped me refine the final prototype</p>
